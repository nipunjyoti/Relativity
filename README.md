# RELATIVITY a slower speed of light
Curious what might happen if the speed of light is slow?       

Here is a simulation when speed of light is much slower, so slower that it comes down near the walking speed.  

## Steps to use it in Unity

Shader graphs are in the shader folder. The ABERRATION shader is the one at work. If you wanna see only effect of Lorentz transformation try LORENTZ shadergraph. Paste all the folder in unity project menu, launch the BasicScene in the Scenes folder and play with it.
